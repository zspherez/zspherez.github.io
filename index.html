                my name is josh rehders.<br><br>    
                <span id="school">I graduated from
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/">vanderbilt university</a>,
                    where I earned a bachelor's degree in computer science as well as minors in engineering management and data science.
                </span><br>
                <br>
                I work full-time on the microsoft loop and m365 copilot notebook/pages iOS team, building AI products to further productivity and collaboration in enterprise settings.<br>
                <br>
                I also work as a freelance <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rehders.photos/">photographer</a>, specializing in concerts and sports, and work to connect the communities I'm involved in through my photographs.
                <br>
            </p>
            <h3>photography, videography, etc</h3>
        <p>
                more recently, my creative work is centering around <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rehders.photos/">electronic music shows</a>, building the a cohesive visual presence for artists large and small within the genre.
                <br><br>
                I also have shot a plethora of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rehders.photos/sports/">sports</a>, ranging from football to baseball, cross country to tennis and more.
                <br>
                the general goal of my work is to showcase the passion of the moment, whether that be in the arts, sports, or anywhere else.
                <br><br>therefore, sometimes I cover <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/26/nashville-scene-reporter-arrested-on-campus-press-denied-entry-to-kirkland-hall/">news</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/tennessee-reporter-arrested-while-covering-student-protest-against-israel-gaza-war/">too</a>, and I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/22/debrief-with-diermeier-principled-neutrality-amid-campus-activism/">interviewed</a> the chancellor of vanderbilt recently, that was cool. 
                <br>as a result of said news coverage, my photos have been used by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://time.com/6975991/campus-protests-student-photojournalists-cover-story/">TIME mag</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/how-vanderbilt-university-balances-free-speech-and-safety-209688133888">NBC</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/living/video/elite-athlete-opens-pressure-best-84052634">twice</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-politics-health-soccer-sports-3ea64a2321a9ce1eabc8d757140c0988">the Associated Press</a> and more.
                <br><br>
                also, I recently bought a(nother) drone (the first one crashed) and am incorporating it into my travel photography style, seen in various highlights on my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://instagram.com/rehders.photos">instagram</a>
